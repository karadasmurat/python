"""
The turtle module provides turtle graphics primitives, in both object-oriented and procedure-oriented ways.

The procedural interface provides functions which are derived from the methods of the classes Screen and Turtle.
They have the same names as the corresponding methods.
A screen object is automatically created whenever a function derived from a Screen method is called.

# in this example, turtle prefix is NOT an object. it is the module name, from "import turtle"
turtle.forward(50)  # function from procedural interface, default turtle.

star = turtle.Turtle()  # turtle instance creation
star.forward(50)  # turtle instance method

Turtle methods> Turtle motion> Move and draw
    forward()   Move the turtle forward by the specified distance, in the direction the turtle is headed.
    backward()  Move the turtle backward by distance, opposite to the direction the turtle is headed.
    right()     Turn turtle right by angle units. (clockwise)
    left()      Turn turtle left by angle units.
    speed()     Set the turtle's speed to an integer value in the range 0..10
    ...
