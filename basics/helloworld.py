Python is a powerful object-oriented programming language.

https://docs.python.org/3/

Interpreted languages do not compile directly to machine code, 
instead, there is a layer above, an interpreter that performs this function.
There are pros and cons to this approach. As you can imagine, on the fly translating can be time
consuming. Interpreted code like Python programs tend to run on the order of 10â€“100 times slower than C
programs. On the flip side, writing code in Python optimizes for developer time.

On many systems Python comes pre-installed. 
Try running the python command to start the Python interpreter to check and see if it is already installed:
To open the interactive interpreter or REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop) that you can use
to write small functions, to test out code samples, or even to function as a calculator:
"""
#   $ python
#   Python 3.10.8 ...
#   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.

#   $ which python
#   /usr/local/bin/python

#   which python3

# If you don't see this, you will need to install Python on your system.

# To run the program:
# $ python helloworld.py

Jupyter Notebooks are a community standard for communicating and performing interactive computing.
They are a document that blends computations, outputs, explanatory text, mathematics, images, and rich media representations of objects.
JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.
