    "# Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a powerful object-oriented programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a high-level, interpreted language developed in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at the National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science in the Netherlands. The name Python, by the way, derives not from the snake, but from the British comedy troupe Monty Python‚Äôs Flying Circus, of which Guido was, and presumably still is, a fan.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- High-level: Abstracts away many low-level details, making it easier to focus on problem-solving rather than machine-specific instructions.\n",
    "- General-purpose: Can be used for a wide range of applications, including web development, data science, machine learning, automation, scientific computing, and more.\n",
    "- Interpreted: Code is executed line by line, without the need for prior compilation, enabling rapid prototyping and experimentation.\n",
    "- Dynamically typed: Data types are determined at runtime, offering flexibility but also requiring attention to potential type-related errors.\n",
    "- Indentation-based: Relies on whitespace (indentation) to define code blocks, promoting readability and a clean visual structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extensive libraries and frameworks: Offers a vast collection of pre-written code for various domains, saving development time and effort.\n",
    "- Large and active community: Benefits from a supportive community of developers, extensive documentation, and online resources.\n",
    "- Cross-platform compatibility: Runs seamlessly on major operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).\n",
    "- Ideal for beginners: Often recommended as a first programming language due to its beginner-friendly syntax and emphasis on readability.\n",
    "- Readability: Emphasizes clear and concise code, making it easier to learn, write, and maintain.\n",
    "- High productivity: Python's overall strength for general-purpose software engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why not Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpreted languages do not compile directly to machine code, instead, there is a layer above, an interpreter that performs this function. There are pros and cons to this approach. As you can imagine, on the fly translating can be time\n",
    "consuming. Interpreted code like Python programs tend to run on the order of 10‚Äì100 times slower than C programs. On the flip side, writing code in Python optimizes for developer time. Because Python code is interpreted and not compiled into native machine instructions, code written for one platform will work on any other platform that has the Python interpreter installed.\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢ As Python is an interpreted programming language, in general most Python code will run substantially slower than code written in a compiled language like Java or C++. Programmer time can be more valuable than CPU time, many are happy to make this trade-off. In an application with very low latency or demanding resource utilization requirements (e.g., a high-frequency trading system), the time spent programming in a lower-level (but also lower-productivity) language like C++ to achieve the maximum possible performance might be time well spent.\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢ Python can be a challenging language for building highly concurrent, multithreaded applications, particularly applications with many CPU-bound threads. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python's Dual Nature:\n",
    "Python is designed for readability and ease of use, with clear syntax and a focus on developer productivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C Implementation: \n",
    "Behind the scenes, the core Python interpreter and standard library are written in C, a lower-level language known for efficiency and direct hardware control.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual Environments in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is essentially a mini-Python universe contained within your actual Python environment. \n",
    "It has its own set of Python packages, independent of your global Python installation. \n",
    "This is incredibly useful for isolating projects and preventing package conflicts. \n",
    "Imagine each project having its own sandbox to play in!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's why you might want to create virtual environments:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Maintain package cleanliness: Avoids cluttering your system's Python installation with unnecessary packages specific to individual projects.\n",
    "- Avoid System Pollution: Linux and macOS come preinstalled with a version of Python that the operating system uses for internal tasks.If you install packages to your operating system‚Äôs global Python, these packages will mix with the system-relevant packages. This mix-up could have unexpected side effects on tasks crucial to your operating system‚Äôs normal behavior.\n",
    "- Isolate project dependencies: Each project can have its own specific package versions without affecting other projects or your system's default Python installation.\n",
    "\tImagine you have an application that needs version 1 of LibFoo, but another application requires version 2. \n",
    "\tIf you have only one place to install packages, then you can‚Äôt work with two different versions of the same library. Python ‚ÄúVirtual Environments‚Äù allow Python packages to be installed in an isolated location for a particular application, rather than being installed globally. \n",
    "- Improve reproducibility: Sharing your virtual environment with collaborators ensures they're working with the same environment and dependencies as you.\n",
    "- Enhance development workflow: Switching between project environments becomes simple and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main ways to create virtual environments in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using venv (built-in with Python 3.3+)\n",
    "2. Using virtualenv (external package)\n",
    "\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- Create a virtual environment\n",
    "```bash\t\n",
    "\t$ python3 -m venv /path/to/new/virtual/environment\n",
    "\t\n",
    "\t$ python3 -m venv /Users/mk/dev/python/environments/mkenv3.10\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Activate virtual environment\n",
    "\tsource is a shell command that executes a script or file in the current shell environment. \n",
    "\tNotice that inside the bin folder, you'll find a script named activate \n",
    "\tThe activate script primarily modifies environment variables, particularly PATH.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\t$ source /Users/mk/dev/python/environments/mkenv3.10/bin/activate\n",
    "     (mkenv3.10) üçè which python    (prompt changes)\n",
    "     /Users/mk/dev/python/environments/mkenv3.10/bin/python\n",
    "     (mkenv3.10) üçè \n",
    "```\n",
    "After creating and activating your virtual environment, you can now install any external dependencies that you need for your project:\n",
    "Note: Before installing a package, look for the name of your virtual environment within parentheses just before your command prompt. \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    (mkenv3.10) $ python3 -m pip install <package-name>\n",
    "    (mkenv3.10) $ python3 -m pip list\n",
    "```\n",
    "to deactivate\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "    (mkenv3.10) $ deactivate\n",
    "    $\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python Packages:\n",
    "Reusable collections of code modules that extend Python's functionality. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key Advantages of Using Packages:\n",
    "- Code reusability: \n",
    "\tLeverage existing, well-tested code instead of writing everything from scratch.\n",
    "- Access to diverse functionality: \n",
    "\tExpand Python's capabilities with a vast array of packages covering various domains.\n",
    "- Collaboration and sharing: \n",
    "\tEasily share code and projects with others by specifying required packages.\n",
    "- Community-driven development: \n",
    "\tBenefit from continuous improvement and innovation within the Python community.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Python Package Index (PyPI) \n",
    "A repository of software for the Python programming language.\n",
    "https://pypi.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Package Installer for Python (pip)\n",
    "You can use pip to install packages from the Python Package Index and other indexes.\n",
    "It's like an app store for Python packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "- Install, upgrade, and uninstall Python packages from PyPI and other indexes.\n",
    "- Manage package dependencies to ensure compatibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic commands:\n",
    "- <code> pip install <package_name></code> : Install a package.\n",
    "- <code> pip uninstall <package_name></code> : Uninstall a package.\n",
    "- <code> pip list</code> : List installed packages.\n",
    "- <code> pip freeze</code> : Generate a list of installed packages with their versions (for creating requirements files).\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "\t(mkenv3.10) bin üçè pip list\n",
    "\tPackage    Version\n",
    "\t---------- -------\n",
    "\tpip        23.3.2\n",
    "\tsetuptools 63.2.0\n",
    "``` \n",
    "Remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always use virtual environments to manage packages and create reproducible project environments.\n",
    "- Explore PyPI ( https://pypi.org/) to discover the incredible variety of Python packages available.\n",
    "- Use pip responsibly to ensure package compatibility and avoid conflicts.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "## Comments\n",
    "To create a comment in Python, start a line with a #\n",
    "Anything that follows the hash is ignored.\n",
    "Other languages support multi-line comments, but Python does not. (You may be tempted to comment out multiple lines of code by making those lines a triple-quoted string.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Indentation\n",
    "In many of these languages, the curly braces, { } denote the boundaries of the if block. \n",
    "One unusual Python feature is that the whitespace indentation of a piece of code affects its meaning. \n",
    "A logical block of statements such as the ones that make up a function should all have the same indentation, set in from the indentation of their parent function or \"if\" or whatever. If one of the lines in a group has a different indentation, it is flagged as a syntax error.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common question beginners ask is, \"How many spaces should I indent?\" \n",
    "- According to the official Python style guide (PEP 8), you should indent with 4 spaces. \n",
    "- Google's internal style guideline dictates indenting by 2 spaces."

    "Data types are determined at runtime, not during compilation. \n",
    "This means you don't need to explicitly declare variable types, offering flexibility.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can change the value and type of a variable later in your code. \n",

    "## Type Hints\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a dynamically typed language, determining variable types at runtime, not during compilation. This offers flexibility but can lead to potential errors if not handled carefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means that it in general it doesn't care about the types of objects we use, as long as we use them in valid ways. In a statically typed language our functions and objects would have specific types.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 introduced type hints. Type hints allow you to indicate what the type is for each argument in a function as well as what what the type is of the object returned by the function. The \"typing\" module contains many types. \n",
    "\n",
    "###¬†The Role of Type Hints:\n",
    "- Optional annotations added to function arguments and return values.\n",
    "- Don't enforce types at runtime but provide valuable information for:\n",
    "  - Developers: Clarify intended types, improving code readability and understanding.\n",
    "  - Tools: Enable static type checkers (like mypy) to detect potential type errors early, reducing runtime surprises.\n",
    "  - IDEs: Offer better code completion, refactoring, and navigation.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Remember, these type annotations don't actually do anything. \n",
    "You can still use the annotated add function to add strings, and the call to add(1, \"two\") will still raise the exact same TypeError"

    "- Mutable objects can change their value in place, in other words, you can alter their state, but their identity stays the same. \n",

    "## Additional Insights:\n",
    "Python optimizes memory usage for small integers (-5 to 256), often caching them to avoid creating new objects for every assignment. \n",
    "This might explain why you might not see ID changes for certain small integer operations.\n",

    "##¬†Python vs C\n",
    "Unlike Python, C's basic numeric types (int, float, etc.) can be modified in-place without creating new objects. \n",
    "C variables typically represent direct memory locations where values are stored, rather than references to objects.\n",
    "C's focus on direct memory manipulation and performance often favors mutable primitives for efficient in-place modifications.\n",

    "# Tuples\n",
    "Tuples are immutable sequences.\n",
    "Tuples are one of the fundamental data structures in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Characteristics:\n",
    "- *Immutable*: Unlike lists, you cannot modify elements after creation (insertion, deletion, or changing values).\n",
    "- *Ordered*: Elements maintain a specific sequence, accessible by their index position (like lists).\n",
    "- *Heterogeneous*: Can hold elements of different data types within a single tuple.\n",
    "- Denoted by parentheses: ()\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parenthesesin Python\n",
    "Parentheses are used for \n",
    "- denoting the calling of functions or methods. \n",
    "- specifying operator precedence. \n",
    "- tuple creation. \n",
    "This overloading of parentheses can lead to confusion. \n",
    "\n",
    "If there are multiple items separated by commas, then Python treats them as a tuple. Note that it is actually the comma which makes a tuple, not the optional parentheses\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "t1 = (3,)\n",
    "t2 = 1, 2, 3\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Tuples implement all of the common sequence operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Distinction between tuples and lists\n",
    "Why not use lists since they appear to be a super-set of tuples?\n",
    "- The main difference between the objects is mutability. This immutability offers several benefits:\n",
    "  - *Useful for Keys*: They are able to serve as keys in dictionaries. \n",
    "\t\tImmutability guarantees consistent hashing and avoids dictionary mutation issues.\n",
    "  - *Data integrity*: Ensures values cannot be accidentally changed, promoting predictable behavior.\n",
    "  - *Hashing efficiency*: Immutable tuples can be hashed faster as their content never changes.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- Tuples are often used to represent a record of data such as the row of a database query, which may contain heterogeneous types of objects. Perhaps a tuple would contain a name, address, and age:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person = ('Matt', '123 North 456 East', 24)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tuples are used for returning multiple items from a function.\n",
    "- Tuples also serve as a hint to the developer that this type is not meant to be modified.\n",
    "- Tuples also use less memory than lists. If you have sequences that you are not mutating, consider using tuples to conserve memory."

    "Unlike sequences, which are indexed by a range of numbers, dictionaries are indexed by keys, (subscript icinde rakam yerine 'key' kullan)\n",
    "which can be any immutable type; strings and numbers can always be keys, whereas a list cannot be a key!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements for Dictionary Keys:\n",
    "- *Uniqueness*: Each key must be unique within the dictionary. \n",
    "\tThis guarantees that each value has a distinct identifier for access.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "- *Immutability*: Keys must be immutable, meaning their value cannot change after creation. \n",

    "- It is possible to have keys of different types.\n",

    "## Characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collection of key-value pairs: Each key uniquely identifies a corresponding value, allowing for efficient access and organization.\n",
    "- Mutable: Both keys and values can be added, removed, or modified after creation.\n",
    "- Heterogeneous: Can hold elements of different data types for both keys and values.\n",
    "- Dictionaries are fundamentally designed for efficient key-value mappings, not specifically for maintaining order. \n",
    "\tIn Python 3.7 and later, the language specification was officially updated to mandate that dictionaries preserve insertion order. The keys are ordered by insertion order, not alphabetic or numeric order.\n",

    "You can compare a Python dictionary to an English dictionary. An English dictionary has words and definitions. The purpose of a dictionary is to allow fast lookup of the word in order to find the definition. You can quickly lookup any word by doing a binary search (open up the dictionary to the midpoint, and determine which half the word is in, and repeat). A Python dictionary also has words and definitions, but you call them keys and values respectively. The purpose of a dictionary is to provide fast lookup of the keys.\n",

    "(it implicitly returns None if the function ends without return being called). \n",
    "Function is an abstraction, providing an interface hiding the implementation details.\n",
    "An advantage of a function is that it enables CODE REUSE. Once a function is defined, you can call it multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "To write the function body block, use : and indentation instead of {}.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main parts of a function are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the <code>def</code> keyword\n",
    "- a function name\n",
    "- function parameters between parentheses\n",
    "- a colon (:)\n",

    "##¬†Parameters\n",

    "- Readability: Improves code clarity by explicitly labelling arguments, especially for functions with a long list of parameters.\n",
    "- Flexibility: Allows you to skip optional arguments or change their order without affecting the function call.\n",
    "- Error Prevention: Reduces the risk of positional errors, where arguments are passed in the wrong order.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "Keyword arguments are defined using a name=value pair syntax. \n",
    "You can mix positional and keyword arguments in the same call, with positional arguments coming first.\n",

    "## Arbitrary Arguments, *args\n",
    "If you do not know how many arguments that will be passed into your function, add a * before the parameter name in the function definition. \n",

    "- Blueprints for Objects: \n",
    "\tClasses serve as templates or blueprints for creating objects, which are instances of those classes.\n",
    "- Encapsulating Data and Behavior: \n",
    "\tThey encapsulate both data (attributes) and the operations that can be performed on that data (methods).\n",
    "- Data Abstraction: \n",
    "\tHide implementation details and provide a clear interface for interacting with objects.\n",
    "- Organizing Code and Modeling Real-World Entities: \n",
    "\tClasses promote code reusability, maintainability, and help model real-world concepts effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ÄúMany object-oriented languages such as C++, Java, and Python use classes to define what state an object can hold and the methods to alter that state. \n",
    "\n",
    "Strings, dictionaries, files, and integers are all objects. Even functions are objects. In Python, almost everything is an object. \n",
    "In Python, str is the name of the class used to store strings. The str class defines the methods of strings. \n",
    "You can create an instance of the str class, b, by using Python‚Äôs literal string syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\tb = \"I'm a string‚Äù\n",
    "```\n",
    "You may hear, \n",
    "- ‚Äúb is a string‚Äù, \n",
    "- ‚Äúb is an object‚Äù, \n",
    "- ‚Äúb is an instance of a string‚Äù. \n",
    "\n",
    "The latter is perhaps the most specific. But, b is not a string class.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Defining a Class\n",
    "It is said that Python comes with ‚Äúbatteries included‚Äù‚Äîit has libraries and classes predefined for your use. These classes tend to be generic. You can define your own classes that deal specifically with your problem domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, classes are not always needed in Python. You should give some thought to whether you need to define a class or whether a function (or group of functions) would be sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have decided that you want to model something with a class, ask yourself the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢ Does it have a name?\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢ What are the properties that is has?\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢ Are these properties constant between instances of the class? ie:\n",
    "\t\t‚óã Which of these properties are common to the class?\n",
    "\t\t‚óã Which of these properties are unique to each member?\n",
    "\t‚Ä¢ What actions does it do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Attributes:\n",
    "- Instance Attributes: Variables defined within a class that store data specific to each object.\n",
    "- Class Attributes: Variables shared by all instances of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods\n",
    "Methods are functions that are attached to a class. \n",
    "Instead of calling the method by itself, you need to call it on an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The first parameter: self\n",
    "The first parameter of a method is always self, referring to the current object.\n",
    "As in Modula-3, there are no shorthands for referencing the object‚Äôs members from its methods: \n",
    "The method is declared with an explicit first argument representing the object, which is provided implicitly by the call if called using an object: object.method() (resembling Go pointer receiver?)\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\tdef payroll(self):\n",
    "\t    return self.hours_worked * self.rate\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Constructor: _ _init_ _():\n",
    "A special method called when an object is created to initialize its attributes.\n",
    "A constructor is called when you create an instance of a class. \n",
    "If you consider a class to be a factory that provides a template or blueprint for instances, then the constructor is what initializes the state for the instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "The constructor takes an instance as input (the self parameter), and updates it inside the method. Python takes care of passing around the\n",

    "\n",
    "## No Access Modifiers\n",
    "Python doesn't have the notion of access modifiers, such as private, protected, and public, to restrict access to attributes and methods in a class. In Python, the distinction is between public and non-public class members.If you want to signal that a given attribute or method is non-public, then you should use the well-established Python convention of prefixing the name with an underscore (_).\n",
    "Note that this is just a convention. \n",
    "It doesn't stop you and other programmers from accessing the attributes using dot notation, as in obj._attr. \n",
